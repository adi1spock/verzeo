## Intro
Given lots of data points on cars on which I had to find best ml model
that fits that. Perform data cleaning and preprocessing. Had to find central tendencies and do data visualization. Had to try different ml models and had to find the best fitting one using metric/error metrics. Out of these it was found that random forest
and decision tree regression were best suited and hence we
implemented it.
